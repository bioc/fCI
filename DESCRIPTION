Description: (f-divergence Cutoff Index), is to find DEGs in the transcriptomic & proteomic data, and identify DEGs by computing the difference between the distribution of fold-changes for the control-control and remaining (non-differential) case-control gene expression ratio data. fCI provides several advantages compared to existing methods.
