Description: (f-divergence Cutoff Index), is to find DEGs in the
        transcriptomic & proteomic data, and identify DEGs by computing
        the difference between the distribution of fold-changes for the
        control-control and remaining (non-differential) case-control
        gene expression ratio data. fCI provides several advantages
        compared to existing methods.
